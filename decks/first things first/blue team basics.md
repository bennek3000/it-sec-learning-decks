**A:** Limit damage, restore functionality, and strengthen defenses to prevent recurrence.

---

### Card 24
**Q:** What are the four core phases of incident response?  
**A:** Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment/Eradication & Recovery, and Post-Incident Review.

---

### Card 25
**Q:** What is malware?  
**A:** Malicious software created to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to systems.

---

### Card 26
**Q:** What is a computer virus?  
**A:** A self-replicating program that attaches to other files or software, spreading and damaging data.

---
