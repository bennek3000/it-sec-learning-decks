# Red Team Basics

A study deck covering the fundamentals of offensive cybersecurity, including Red Team methodologies, attack phases, and ethical considerations.  
Designed to reinforce key Red Team concepts for learners pursuing offensive security or penetration testing roles.

### Card 1
**Q:** What is the main objective of Red Teaming?  
**A:** To simulate real-world cyberattacks and test an organization's detection, response, and defense capabilities under realistic conditions.

---

### Card 2
**Q:** How does Red Teaming differ from traditional penetration testing?  
**A:** Penetration testing focuses on finding vulnerabilities in specific systems, while Red Teaming assesses the overall security posture, response, and detection across the organization.

---

### Card 3
**Q:** What is the ultimate goal of a Red Team exercise?  
**A:** To identify weaknesses in people, processes, and technology that could be exploited by adversaries, and help improve defensive readiness.

---

### Card 4
**Q:** What is the core principle of offensive security?  
**A:** "Think like an attacker" — understanding and emulating adversary tactics to uncover vulnerabilities before malicious actors do.

---

### Card 5
**Q:** What is the ethical foundation of Red Teaming?  
**A:** All testing must be authorized, controlled, and designed to strengthen security, not cause damage or disruption.

---

### Card 6
**Q:** What are the main phases of a Red Team engagement?  
**A:** Planning and Reconnaissance, Scanning and Enumeration, Exploitation, Privilege Escalation, Post-Exploitation, and Reporting.

---

### Card 7
**Q:** What occurs during the reconnaissance phase?  
**A:** Gathering open-source and network information about the target to identify potential attack vectors.

---

### Card 8
**Q:** What is the purpose of scanning and enumeration?  
**A:** To map active hosts, open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

---

### Card 9
**Q:** What happens during exploitation?  
**A:** Attackers use identified weaknesses to gain unauthorized access or control of systems.

---

### Card 10
**Q:** What is privilege escalation?  
**A:** The process of gaining higher-level permissions within a compromised system to expand control or access sensitive data.

---

### Card 11
**Q:** What is post-exploitation?  
**A:** Maintaining access, gathering valuable information, and preparing reports — often followed by cleanup to restore the environment.

---

### Card 12
**Q:** Why is reporting a crucial phase in Red Teaming?  
**A:** It documents findings, impact, and recommendations to help defenders strengthen systems and close identified gaps.

---

### Card 13
**Q:** What is an adversary simulation?  
**A:** A realistic emulation of specific threat actors or attack techniques to measure an organization's resilience.

---

### Card 14
**Q:** What are "Rules of Engagement" in Red Team operations?  
**A:** The agreed-upon boundaries, objectives, and constraints that define what is and isn't allowed during the engagement.

---

### Card 15
**Q:** What is the difference between a Red Team and a Blue Team?  
**A:** The Red Team conducts simulated attacks to test defenses, while the Blue Team monitors, detects, and responds to those attacks.

---

### Card 16
**Q:** What is a Purple Team?  
**A:** A collaborative effort between Red and Blue Teams to improve communication, share findings, and enhance overall security posture.

---

### Card 17
**Q:** What is social engineering in the context of Red Teaming?  
**A:** The use of deception to manipulate people into revealing information or performing actions that compromise security.

---

### Card 18
**Q:** What are some common tools used in Red Team operations?  
**A:** Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, Nmap, Burp Suite, and custom scripts for reconnaissance and exploitation.

---

### Card 19
**Q:** Why is operational security (OPSEC) important for Red Teams?  
**A:** To ensure the testing activities remain stealthy, realistic, and do not expose sensitive information or harm production systems.

---

### Card 20
**Q:** How do Red Team findings benefit the Blue Team?  
**A:** They reveal real-world weaknesses and provide actionable insights to strengthen detection and response capabilities.
